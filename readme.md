### WIP

An ESPHome toddler sleep trainer, based on the [Groclock](https://www.target.com.au/p/the-gro-company-groclock/51891015) and written for the [Guition ESP32-S3-4848S040](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/Guition-ESP32-S3-4848S040).

Can be integrated into Home Assistant or used standalone via a built-in web server.

Install via the ESPHome Builder Home Assistant add-on. Copy the contents of `groclock.yaml` to the device configuration, changing the name and wifi details as needed.

### Features
* Set up to three separate sleep timers
* "Star countdown" around the outside of the sleep screen before wake up time
* Show/hide the current time
